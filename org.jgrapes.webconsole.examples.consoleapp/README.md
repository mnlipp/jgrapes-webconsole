Basic Web Console Configuration
===============================

This package provides a very basic, sample web console configuration
which can be used for testing and demonstration purposes. It provides
the web console with HTTP (port 8888) and HTTPS (port 8443) access.

When started with page providers and web conlets in the classpath,
these will be automatically picked up and added to the console 
configuration.
